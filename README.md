# What is Feedbackr
It's a web application where we can create multiple choice quizzes, share them, and ofcourse, try these quizzes and see how well we did using the score report feature.

# Getting started
1. Fork the repo and clone your fork to your development environment
2. Set up 3 terminal windows and run the following
 a) Navigate to the server folder and run `npm install` in your terminal to install dependencies. Then simply run `node index.js` to get the backend running. You should be greeted with `server listening on http://localhost:3001` 
 b) In a second terminal navigate to the client folder and run `npm install` in your terminal to install dependencies. Then simply run `npm start` to get the react frontend running. You should see the app open up in your browser at http://localhost:3000 - the default react port.
 c) If you want to play around with the styling on SASS, you can `npm run watch:sass` on a terminal on while in the client folder. This will keep the page refreshing as you add or remove styling.
 
And that's it!! Happy coding
